## Chapter 1: Clean Code
The main goal of this chapter is to ease you into the concept of "Clean Code." It introduces you to a few famous people from the world of coding and their vision of what "Clean Code" is. This chapter also prepares you for the book's structure and emphasizes that you should read the code as you read (pardon the tautology) the book; otherwise, it won't make sense. The author highlights the importance of coding cleanly throughout the chapter.

**What Is Clean Code?**

Inventor of C++, *Bjerne Stroustrup*
>I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and per- formance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprinci- pled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.

Godfather of the Eclipse strategy, *Dave Thomas*
>Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal depen- dencies, which are explicitly defined, and pro- vides a clear and minimal API.
